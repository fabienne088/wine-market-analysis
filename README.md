# Wine market analysis with Vivino database! :chart_with_upwards_trend: :wine_glass: 

## Introduction
Wine plays a significant role in the alcohol market. It encompasses a wide range of types, from mass-produced to luxury varieties. Each country has its unique wine-related traditions and preferences. To enhance marketing campaigns and boost sales for large wholesale companies, utilizing databases is essential across all countries. 
In this project, we attempt to answer a range of wine business questions using the database that comprises data from a large wine retail website.
This is a learning project aimed at consolidating SQL knowledge and Tableau visualization skills and was a part of BeCode Data and AI training. 

## Project Description
In this project, a range of questions of a wholesale wine company were answered:
1. Which 10 wines the company needs to highlight to increase the sales?
2. Which wine exporting country should the company prioritise due to the limited marketing budget for this year?
3. Which wineries should we award and why?
4. What wines can be described by the following taste: *coffee, toast, green apple, cream, citrus*?
5. What are the top 3 most common grapes all over the world, and what are the 5 best-rated wines for each type?
6. Create a visual leaderboard for the average wine and vintage rating in each country.
7. Which wines should the company recommend to a VIP client who likes Cabernet Sauvignon?
